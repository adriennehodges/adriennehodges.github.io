				<h2>About Adrienne</h2>

				<p>
				After majoring in Political Science and Spanish at Furman University, I found myself in Madrid teaching English and especially loving the part of my job that required me to create visual teaching aids for my lessons and games with the students. I decided then that I would pursue a career in Graphic Design and make things like that for a living; I would use my talent to help people learn and communicate better.
				<br>
				<br>
				Fast forward to today -- I am a Graphic Designer with four years experience creating and maintaining brand identities across print and digital media. Because design and web development go hand-in-hand, I am excited to be extending my creative abilities to Front-End Development by taking classes at Charleston Code Camp. I have a passion for creating awesome user experiences, both for print and digital, and I love taking the creative and problem-solving skills I use as a designer and applying those to web development. It's exciting to take a design and bring it to life on the web.
				<br>
				<br>
				Take a look around, and get in touch if you have a cool project you want to work on together.
